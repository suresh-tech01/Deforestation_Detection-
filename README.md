# ðŸ”¥ Fire Type Classification Using MODIS Satellite Data

This project classifies fire types in India using MODIS satellite data. It uses a machine learning model to predict whether a fire is a Vegetation Fire, Other Static Land Source, or Offshore Fire based on thermal and spatial features.

The model takes input features such as brightness, brightness T31, fire radiative power (FRP), scan, track, and confidence level. A Streamlit-based web app allows users to input these parameters and receive real-time fire type predictions.
